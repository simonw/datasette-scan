Datasette plugin that scans directories for SQLite database files and serves them.

## Installation

Install this plugin in the same environment as Datasette.
```bash
datasette install datasette-scan
```

## Usage

Scan the current directory for SQLite files and serve them:

```bash
datasette scan
```

Scan a specific directory:

```bash
datasette scan /path/to/directory
```

Scan multiple directories and include explicit database files:

```bash
datasette scan /data/projects /data/archives extra.db
```

Specify a port (or any other `datasette serve` option):

```bash
datasette scan -p 8001
```

All options accepted by `datasette serve` are also accepted by `datasette scan` -- these are introspected at runtime, so new options added to future versions of Datasette will be picked up automatically.

### How it works

- Positional arguments that are **directories** are scanned recursively for SQLite files using the [sqlite-scanner](https://pypi.org/project/sqlite-scanner/) binary, which identifies SQLite files by their magic bytes rather than file extension.
- Positional arguments that are **files** are passed through directly as database files.
- If no positional arguments are given, the current directory (`.`) is scanned.
- Discovered files are then served as if you had run `datasette serve file1.db file2.db ...`.

### Continuous scanning

Use `--scan-interval` to periodically re-scan directories for new SQLite files while the server is running. New databases will be added automatically.

```bash
datasette scan /data --scan-interval 5
```

This re-scans every 5 seconds. Any new SQLite files that appear in the scanned directories will be added to the running Datasette instance without a restart.

### Corrupted and locked files

Since `datasette scan` discovers files automatically, it takes precautions against problematic databases:

- **Corrupted files are skipped.** Each discovered file is validated by running `SELECT * FROM sqlite_master` before it is served. Files that fail this check are skipped with a warning to stderr.
- **Locked files are handled safely.** The `--nolock` flag is enabled by default, so databases locked by another process are opened in read-only mode instead of causing the server to fail.

These protections apply to files discovered by scanning directories. Explicit file arguments are passed through to `datasette serve` without validation.

### Examples

Scan the current directory and open in a browser:

```bash
datasette scan -o
```

Scan with CORS enabled on a custom port:

```bash
datasette scan /data --cors -p 9000
```

Use `--get` to test without starting a server:

```bash
datasette scan /data --get /.json
```

## Development

To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code. You can confirm it is available like this:
```bash
cd datasette-scan
# Confirm the plugin is visible
uv run datasette plugins
```
To run the tests:
```bash
uv run pytest
```
